## Twitter Crypto Whale Bot

FOX Whale filters out transfers that have a value of 250,000 or more $FOX using the GraphQL API and creates a tweet with the transfer information. This script schedules the fetch_data function to run three times a day at specified times to continuously post tweets that meet the criteria.
