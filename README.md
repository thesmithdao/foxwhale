## Twitter Crypto Whale Bot

FOX Whale filters out transfers that have a value of 500,000 or more $FOX using the GraphQL API and creates a tweet with the transfer information. This script schedules the fetch_data function to run three times a day at specified times to continuously post tweets that meet the criteria. 

Ask for FOX-API if you want to query and build around FOX Graph: https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/GvJCEpMuyymPEYJ8dLWvKFtBy1sz3bywdRSPzfY46MDR?view=Overview&chain=mainnet
